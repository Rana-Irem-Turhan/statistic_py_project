# statistic_py_project
This project defines a Python function `calculate()` that computes basic statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum) for a 3x3 matrix. The input is a list of 9 numbers, which the function reshapes into a 3x3 matrix. The function returns a dictionary with calculations for rows, columns, and the entire matrix.
